# Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to my project, focusing on Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) in the context of systems biology. The document is structured into three main sections: Introduction, FBA and Linear Approximation. Each section is designed to offer both a theoretical understanding and practical insights into the methodologies and applications of FBA as well as the purpose of the project and its impact.

## 1. Introduction
